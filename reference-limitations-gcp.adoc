The following known limitations are specific to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud Platform. Be sure to also review link:reference-limitations.html[Limitations for Cloud Volumes ONTAP in all cloud providers].

== Limitation with packet mirroring

https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/packet-mirroring[Packet mirroring^] must be disabled in the Google Cloud VPC in which you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

Cloud Volumes ONTAP can't operate properly if packet mirroring is enabled.

== Google Private Service Connect limitations

If you leverage https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect[Google Private Service Connect^] within the VPC that you are deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP into, you will need to implement DNS records that forward traffic to the required https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-gcp.html#outbound-internet-access[Cloud Manager API Endpoints^].

Tiering data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP into a Google Cloud Storage bucket is not currently supported with Private Service Connect.
