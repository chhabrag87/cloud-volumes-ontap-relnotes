Several Cloud Volumes ONTAP configurations are supported in Azure.

== Supported configurations by license

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in Azure as a single node system and as a high-availability (HA) pair of nodes for fault tolerance and nondisruptive operations.

Upgrading a single node system to an HA pair is not supported. If you want to switch between a single node system and an HA pair, then you need to deploy a new system and replicate data from the existing system to the new system.

=== Single node systems

You can choose from the following configurations when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP as a single-node system in Azure:

Notes:

. Data tiering to Azure Blob storage isn't supported with PAYGO Explore.

. This VM type includes local NVMe storage, which Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses as _Flash Cache_. Flash Cache speeds access to data through real-time intelligent caching of recently read user data and NetApp metadata. It is effective for random read-intensive workloads, including databases, email, and file services. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-flash-cache.html[Learn more^].

. These VM types use an https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disks-enable-ultra-ssd[Ultra SSD^] for VNVRAM, which provides better write performance.
+
If you choose any of these VM types when you deploy a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, you can't change to another VM type that _doesn't_ use an Ultra SSD for VNVRAM. For example, you can't change from E8ds_v4 to E8s_v3, but you can change from E8ds_v4 to E32ds_v4 because both of those VM types use Ultra SSDs.
+
Conversely, if you deployed Cloud Volumes ONTAP using any other VM type, you won't be able to change to a VM type that uses an Ultra SSD for VNVRAM. For example, you can't change from E8s_v3 to E8ds_v4.

. High write speed is supported with all instance types when using a single node system. You can enable high write speed from BlueXP during deployment or any time after. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-write-speed.html[Learn more about choosing a write speed^].

. Enhanced write performance is enabled when using SSDs.

. For Azure region support, see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[Cloud Volumes Global Regions^].

. Cloud Volumes ONTAP can run on either a Reserved or On-demand VM instance from your cloud provider. Solutions that use other VM instance types aren't supported.

. Single node deployments only support locally redundant storage (LRS) managed disks for Standard SSD and HDD and Premium SSD.

=== HA pairs with shared managed disks
You can choose from the following configurations when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP as an HA pair in Azure.

Notes:

. Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports high write speed with these VM types when using an HA pair. You can enable high write speed from BlueXP during deployment or any time after. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-write-speed.html[Learn more about choosing a write speed^].

. This VM is recommended only when Azure maintenance control is needed. It's not recommended for any other use case due to the higher pricing.

. These VM types are only supported for HA pairs in a single availability zone configuration running on shared managed disks. 

. These VM types are supported for HA pairs in single availability zone and multiple availability zone configurations running on shared managed disks.

. This VM type includes local NVMe storage, which Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses as _Flash Cache_. Flash Cache speeds access to data through real-time intelligent caching of recently read user data and NetApp metadata. It is effective for random read-intensive workloads, including databases, email, and file services. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-flash-cache.html[Learn more^].

//. PAYGO Explore isn't supported with HA pairs in Azure.

//. For Azure region support, see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[Cloud Volumes Global Regions^].

//. Cloud Volumes ONTAP can run on either a Reserved or On-demand VM instance from your cloud provider. Solutions that use other VM instance types aren't supported.

== Supported disk sizes

In Azure, an aggregate can contain up to 12 disks that are all the same type and size.

=== Single node systems

Single node systems use Azure Managed Disks. The following disk sizes are supported:
