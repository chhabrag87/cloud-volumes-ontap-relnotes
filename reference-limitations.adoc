Known limitations identify platforms, devices, or functions that are not supported by this release of the product, or that do not interoperate correctly with it. Review these limitations carefully.

The following limitations apply to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in all cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

== SVM disaster recovery limitation

If you set up SnapMirror SVM replication between two Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, the replication must be between two HA pair systems or two single node systems. You can't set up SnapMirror SVM replication between a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair and a single node system.

== Maximum concurrent replication operations

The maximum number of concurrent SnapMirror or SnapVault transfers for Cloud Volumes ONTAP is 100 per node, regardless of the instance type or machine type.

== Cloud provider snapshots must not be used for your backup and recovery plans

You shouldn't use your cloud provider's snapshots as part of your backup and recovery plan for Cloud Volumes ONTAP data. You should always use ONTAP Snapshot copies or third-party backup solutions to back up and restore data hosted on Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/concept-backup-to-cloud.html[Learn how to use BlueXP backup and recovery to back up and restore ONTAP data^].

NOTE: ONTAP consistency points in the WAFL file system determine data consistency. Only ONTAP can quiesce the WAFL file system to make a crash-consistent backup.

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports Reserved and On-demand VM instances

Cloud Volumes ONTAP can run on either a Reserved or On-demand VM instance from your cloud provider. Other types of VM instances aren't supported.

== Automatic application resource management solutions shouldn't be used

Automatic application resource management solutions should not manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. Doing so can result in a change to an unsupported configuration. For example, the solution might change Cloud Volumes ONTAP to an unsupported VM instance type.

== Software updates must be completed by BlueXP

Upgrades of Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be completed from BlueXP. You should not upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP by using System Manager or the CLI. Doing so can impact system stability.

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployment must not be modified from your cloud providerâ€™s console

Changes to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP configuration from your cloud provider's console results in an unsupported configuration. Any changes to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP resources that BlueXP creates and manages can impact system stability and BlueXP's ability to manage the system.

== Disks and aggregates must be managed from BlueXP

All disks and aggregates must be created and deleted directly from BlueXP. You should not perform these actions from another management tool. Doing so can impact system stability, hamper the ability to add disks in the future, and potentially generate redundant cloud provider fees.

== SnapManager licensing limitation

SnapManager per-server licenses are supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Per-storage system (SnapManager suite) licenses are not supported.

== Unsupported ONTAP features

The following features are not supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP:

* Aggregate-level inline deduplication
* Aggregate-level background deduplication
* Disk maintenance center
* Disk sanitization
* FabricPool mirroring
* Fibre Channel (FC)
* Flash Pools
* Infinite Volumes
* Interface groups
* Intranode LIF failover
* MetroCluster
* Multi-admin verification
+
Enabling multi-admin verification on Cloud Volumes ONTAP will result in an unsupported configuration.
* RAID4, RAID-DP, RAID-TEC (RAID0 is supported)
* Service Processor
* SnapLock Compliance and Enterprise modes (only Cloud WORM is supported)
* SnapMirror Synchronous
* VLANs
