* Cache rewarming after a reboot is not supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Pay-as-you-go not available for CSP partners

If you are a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner, you cannot deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP Explore, Standard, or Premium because pay-as-you-go subscriptions are not available for CSP partners. You must purchase a license and deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL.
